# go-coding-journey
This Repo is all about my go coding journey and development

In order to contribute to a project as a azure focused cloud devops engineer come development resource, I was assigned to spend 50% of efforts into development of microservices from scratch and feature development of existing microservices project related to Industrial IOT. 

So, starting from today(9/09/2025), I started learning go lang first, as we have only 1 developer with go based development background and that particular area needs a bit more support.

Reason why I'm sharing my personal journey is that, I followed someone's learning path and escaped a lot of pit-falls they faced. Same way If anyone is learning go with relative cause, may be they get benifited from this.
